# The Hacking Project - Crypto Scrapper


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to make a site that **scraps** and then **displays the value of a given cryptocurrency**.


**The live version : http://mxrch-crypto.herokuapp.com/**

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_crypto
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
